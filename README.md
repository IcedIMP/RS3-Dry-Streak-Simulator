# RS3-Dry-Streak-Simulator

Python script for use in simulating likely dry streak/maximum dry streak
one is likely to experience when farming a boss in RS (specifically RS3 
bosses implemented).

Switching which boss and how many runs are simulated requires manual
changes within the main() function. Follow documentation within the
function for what to comment/uncomment to switch bosses or for examples
of how to add other bosses.

Default is set to Elite Dungeon 2 and simulating 1.5 million runs
